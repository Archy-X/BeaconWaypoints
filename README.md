# Beacon Waypoints
### This plugin gives beacons extra functionality by letting players use beacons to fast travel between them! Install this plugin by putting the jar file into your plugins folder and starting/restarting the server.


Developed and tested for version 1.18.1

## Features
- Create public or private waypoints at beacons
- Configurable icon chooser for waypoints


## Commands
- /waypoint <name> <public | private> - Create a public or private waypoint for the beacon the player is standing on

Note: Teleportation between beacons requires the beacon to have no blocks inside it, including transparent blocks like glass. Bedrock is an exception, so this plugin will work in the Nether.
