Fixes:
- Added compatibility with NoCheatPlus by adding temporary exemptions when a player is teleporting.
- Added launch-player-height config option to change how high players are launched before teleporting. Anti-cheat plugins might not allow players above a certain height, so this is a way to work around that.
