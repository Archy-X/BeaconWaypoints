Changes:
- Added bStats.
- Added a config option "disable-group-teleporting" that prevents all players standing on a beacon from teleporting at the same time when it was activated, and instead only teleports the player choosing the destination, when enabled.
- Added config reload command (/waypoints reload). This adds the permission BeaconWaypoints.reload which is enabled for operators by default.
- Changed the icon for the "Options for this waypoint" button from a comparator to the icon of the waypoint being interacted with.
- Added an update checker that notifies the console and operators of an update to the plugin.

Bug Fixes:
- A waypoint was not deleted if the beacon was removed with the setblock or fill commands. Changing or deleting blocks using WorldEdit still does not remove the waypoint.
- BeaconWaypoints could conflict with other plugins and make players take fall damage when landing on the destination beacon.
